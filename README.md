# Monitoring of Beneficial Birds in Agricultural Ecosystems

### Project Overview
In 2019, a colleague and I launched the Monitoring of Beneficial Birds in Agricultural Ecosystems initiative. The purpose of this project is to connect sustainable land use practices with changes in native bird communities. We are particularly interested in species that provide ecosystem services or are of conservation concern. To date, we have completed four survey seasons (Fall 2019, Spring 2020, Spring 2021, and Summer 2021) at five organic farms in Ford County, Illinois.
